# Data Platform - general schema

A modern data platform typically consists of several layers, each serving a specific purpose in the data lifecycle. Here are the key layers:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer:** This is the entry point for data into the platform. It involves collecting data from various sources, which could be databases, APIs, files, or real-time data streams. This layer often involves tools for batch and real-time data ingestion.

2. **Data Storage Layer:** Once ingested, data needs to be stored for further processing. This layer involves databases and data storage systems. Depending on the nature of the data and the use case, this could involve relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, or data lakes.

3. **Data Processing Layer:** This layer involves transforming and cleaning the data to make it suitable for analysis. This could involve ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data cleaning, data normalization, and more. This layer often involves big data processing tools and frameworks.

4. **Data Analysis Layer:** This is where the data is analyzed to extract insights. This could involve querying the data, performing statistical analysis, running machine learning models, and more. This layer often involves data analysis tools and languages, as well as machine learning platforms.

5. **Data Presentation Layer:** The insights derived from the data need to be presented in a way that's understandable to end users. This could involve dashboards, reports, visualizations, and more. This layer often involves data visualization tools and BI (Business Intelligence) platforms.

6. **Data Governance Layer:** This involves managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data. This includes data quality management, data cataloging, data lineage, data privacy, and data security measures.

7. **Data Orchestration Layer:** This layer involves managing and automating the data workflows and pipelines. This includes scheduling jobs, managing dependencies between jobs, handling errors and retries, and more.

Remember, a modern data platform is not just about the technology stack, but also about the people, processes, and culture. It requires a cross-functional team with skills in data engineering, data science, data governance, and more. It also requires a culture of data-driven decision making, where data is treated as a valuable asset.
