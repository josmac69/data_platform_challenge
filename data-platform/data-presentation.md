# Data presentation

* Preparing and storing data for presentation involves several steps, including data collection, data cleaning, data transformation, and data storage.
* * Here's a detailed description of how you might use Azure tools for each step:

1. **Data Collection:** The first step in preparing data for presentation is to collect the data. This could involve extracting data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files, and more. Azure provides several tools for data collection:

   - **Azure Data Factory:** This is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation.

   - **Azure Event Hubs:** This is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second, which makes it suitable for real-time data ingestion.

   - **Azure IoT Hub:** If your data comes from IoT devices, Azure IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Once the data is collected, it often needs to be cleaned. This could involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistent data. Azure Databricks, an Apache Spark-based analytics platform, can be used for data cleaning. It provides a collaborative notebook environment where you can write Spark code to clean your data.

3. **Data Transformation:** The data may need to be transformed into a format suitable for analysis. This could involve operations such as aggregation, normalization, and conversion of data types. Azure Data Factory can be used for these Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations.

4. **Data Storage:** After the data is cleaned and transformed, it needs to be stored in a way that's suitable for analysis and presentation. Azure provides several data storage options:

   - **Azure SQL Database:** This is a fully managed relational database with built-in intelligence that supports self-driving features such as performance tuning and threat alerts.

   - **Azure Cosmos DB:** This is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. It's suitable for applications that need seamless and fast access to their data, regardless of where they are in the world.

   - **Azure Data Lake Storage:** This is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective data lake that allows you to run big data analytics and AI workloads from one place.

   - **Azure Blob Storage:** This is a scalable, object storage solution for unstructured data. It's suitable for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

5. **Data Presentation:** Finally, for the data to be useful, it needs to be presented in a way that's easy to understand. Azure Power BI is a suite of business analytics tools that deliver insights throughout your organization. You can connect Power BI to your data storage solution, create reports and dashboards, and share them with others in your organization.

Remember, the choice of tools can vary based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
