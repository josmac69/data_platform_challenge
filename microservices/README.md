# Microservices principles

Ancillary Marketplace(AMP) is an API-Ô¨Årst ecommerce solution that is composed of various microservices built in alignment with Domain Driven Design principles.

## Context of data engineering.

### API-first
* "API-first," which means that it is designed with the Application Programming Interface (API) as the primary interface.
* An API is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.
* An API-first approach means that the development of the API is prioritized and considered the foundation of the application's functionality.
* This approach is beneficial because it promotes consistency, reusability, and it can make the development process more efficient.

### Microservices
* *Microservices, or the microservice architecture, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable, and organized around business capabilities.
* This architecture enables the rapid, frequent, and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
* These microservices are built in alignment with "Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles."
* DDD is an approach to software development that centers the development on the core domain and domain logic, bases complex designs on a model of the domain, initiates a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
* In simpler terms, DDD focuses on the 'business needs' first, and then develops software to meet those needs.
* This approach helps to reduce the complexity of the software, makes it more flexible, and aligns it more closely with business requirements.
