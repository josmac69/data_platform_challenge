# Data Driven Design

* Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration between technical experts and domain experts.
* The "domain" in DDD refers to the subject area of the software, which is often a specific business or industry.
* The goal of DDD is to create software that accurately reflects the model of the domain. Here are the key principles of DDD:

1. **Focus on the Core Domain and Domain Logic:**
* The core domain refers to the most critical business area that the software is being built for.
* Focusing on the core domain means that the software should be designed to solve problems specifically within this area.
* This is where the software will provide the most value.

2. **Base Complex Designs on a Model of the Domain:**
* A model is a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.
* In DDD, complex designs should be based on a model that accurately reflects the domain.
* This model serves as the backbone of the software design and development.

3. **Collaborate with Domain Experts:**
* Domain experts are individuals who have extensive knowledge and experience in the domain.
* Collaboration between technical experts (developers) and domain experts is crucial in DDD.
* This collaboration helps to ensure that the software being developed accurately reflects the needs and realities of the domain.

4. **Use a Ubiquitous Language:**
* A ubiquitous language is a common language that is created around the domain model and is used by all team members (developers, domain experts, stakeholders, etc.) to connect all the activities of the team with the software.
* This language should be used in all forms of communication within the team, including discussions, diagrams, and code.
* The goal is to reduce misunderstandings and ensure that everyone has a common understanding of the domain and the software.

5. **Implement Model-Driven Design:**
* In DDD, the design of the software should be based on and evolve with the domain model.
* This includes the design of the software's architecture, interfaces, and data structures.
* The code should reflect the model, and any changes in the model should be reflected in the code.

6. **Highlight Bounded Contexts:**
* A bounded context is a specific responsibility that corresponds to a particular model within the domain.
* It sets the boundaries within which a model is applicable.
* Recognizing and dealing with these bounded contexts is crucial in DDD to avoid model ambiguity and to ensure that the model and the implementation remain consistent.

7. **Evolve the Model:**
* The domain model should not be static; it should evolve over time based on new insights, changing requirements, and feedback from the implementation of the software.
* This iterative refinement of the model is a key aspect of DDD.

In summary, DDD is all about understanding the domain, representing it accurately in a model, and using that model to drive the design and development of the software. It involves close collaboration between technical and domain experts, a common language, and an evolving model.
