# Azure Messaging Systems

## Azure Event Grid
* Azure Event Grid is a fully managed event routing service that allows for uniform event consumption using a publish-subscribe model.
* It is designed to build applications with event-based architectures.

### Key Features:
- Simplified event consumption and lowered costs with a single service for managing routing of events from any source to any destination.
- Built-in support for events coming from Azure services, like storage blobs and resource groups.
- Event Grid also has support for your own events, using custom topics.
- Serverless platforms in Azure can respond to events.
- Reliable event delivery with a 24-hour retry policy for unacknowledged events, with the ability to choose a destination retry policy.
- Use filters to route specific events to different endpoints, multicast to multiple endpoints, and make sure your events are reliably delivered.

### Typical Use Cases:
1. **Automation of Application Operations**: Event Grid can help automate operations, like rotating secrets on a VM when a new secret is available in Azure Key Vault.
2. **Serverless Architectures**: It can respond to changes in Azure resources, like creating a thumbnail when an image is added to a blob storage.
3. **Operations and Management Automation**: It can handle events from Azure services, third-party services, or your own applications to react to status changes.

## Azure Event Hubs
* Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service.
* It can receive and process millions of events per second.
* Data sent to an Event Hub can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.

### Key Features:
- Capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second, which makes it suitable for big data scenarios.
- Provides a Kafka interface for applications that already use Kafka.
- Allows for multiple event publishers and subscribers—an ideal solution for scenarios where high throughput is a mandatory requirement.
- Offers features like Capture (automatic delivery of the stream to an Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Store), Auto-Inflate (automatically scales the number of throughput units), and Geo Disaster Recovery (GeoDR).

### Typical Use Cases:
1. **Anomaly Detection**: Event Hubs can be used to ingest, process, and analyze data in real-time to detect anomalies and patterns on live data.
2. **Live Dashboarding**: It can be used to power live dashboards and monitoring systems that need to reflect updates in real-time.
3. **Archiving Data**: With the Capture feature, you can automatically deliver the streaming data in Event Hubs to an Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Store for long-term retention or micro-batch processing.

## Azure Storage Queues
* Azure Storage Queues offer a reliable and persistent messaging between and within services.
* They are designed to be durable, meaning that messages are never lost and can be read more than once.
* Storage Queues are part of the larger Azure Storage infrastructure, which includes Blob Storage, File Storage, and Table Storage.

### Key Features:
- Simple, cost-effective, and durable message queuing for large workloads.
- Rich client libraries for .NET, Java, Android, C++, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, and Python.
- Data accessible via the REST API.
- Decoupling of components for better durability across large workloads.
- Resilience built into the system, buffering messages if part of your architecture goes down, maintaining the integrity of your workload.
- Scalability for bursts, absorbing unexpected traffic bursts and preventing servers from being overwhelmed by a sudden flood of requests.

### Typical Use Cases:
1. **Decoupling Components**: Azure Queue Storage can be used to build flexible applications and separate functions for better durability across large workloads. This allows application components to scale independently.
2. **Building Resilience**: Queue Storage helps to make your application scalable and less sensitive to individual component failure. If part of your architecture goes down, messages are buffered, and then naturally picked up by other message processing nodes, which maintains the integrity of your workload.
3. **Scaling for Bursts**: Use Queue Storage to rightsize your service deployment. Applications absorb unexpected traffic bursts, which prevents servers from being overwhelmed by a sudden flood of requests.

## Azure Service Bus
* Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise integration message broker.
* It can decouple applications and services from each other, providing reliable and secure asynchronous transfer of state and data.

### Key Features:
- Provides a highly reliable cloud messaging service between applications and services, even when they’re offline.
- Available in every Azure region, this fully managed service eliminates the burdens of server management and licensing.
- Offers structured first-in, first-out (FIFO) messaging and publish/subscribe capabilities.
- Enables existing Java Message Service (JMS) applications to talk to Service Bus over AMQP.
- Protects your application from temporary spikes in traffic.

### Typical Use Cases:
1. **Building Scalable Cloud Solutions**: Leverage the power of asynchronous messaging patterns to reliably scale your enterprise applications. Integrate cloud resources such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage, and Web Apps with Service Bus messaging to get smooth operation under variable loads and the durability to survive intermittent failures.
2. **Implementing Complex Messaging Workflows**: Improve availability by building messaging topologies with complex routing. Use Service Bus to deliver messages to multiple subscribers and fan out message delivery at scale to downstream systems.
3. **Enabling JMS Applications**: Get a fully managed enterprise messaging service with native JMS support without worrying about licenses and operational costs of running your messaging broker in an on-premises or infrastructure as a service (IaaS) environment.

## Summary
* All these services - Event Grid, Event Hubs, Storage Queues, and Service Bus - provide different capabilities for handling events and messages in Azure.
* The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of application, such as the volume of messages, the need for real-time processing, the complexity of the messaging patterns, and the level of control needed over ordering and delivery.
