# Azure SQL database

Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service provided by Microsoft in the Azure cloud. It offers the broadest SQL Server engine compatibility and provides a managed service experience that allows you to focus on application development rather than database management tasks.

**Architecture:**

Azure SQL Database is built on the SQL Server Database Engine architecture, optimized for the cloud environment. Here are some key components of its architecture:

1. **Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS):** Azure SQL Database is a fully managed service. This means that Microsoft takes care of infrastructure maintenance, updates, and backups, allowing you to focus on application development.

2. **Built-In High Availability:** Azure SQL Database has built-in high availability and fault tolerance. It automatically handles patching, backups, replication, failure detection, underlying hardware, software or network failures, deploying bug fixes, failovers, database upgrades, and other maintenance tasks.

3. **Scalability:** Azure SQL Database allows you to scale up or down your compute and storage resources on-demand. You can choose between provisioned and serverless compute tiers based on your workload needs.

4. **Security:** Azure SQL Database provides advanced security features like Azure Active Directory integration, encryption at rest and in transit, Advanced Threat Protection, and compliance with various industry standards.

**Underlying Technology:**

Azure SQL Database is built on the SQL Server Database Engine, which is a proven, enterprise-grade relational database engine. It uses the Azure cloud infrastructure for compute and storage resources. The service is integrated with other Azure services for advanced analytics, AI, and other capabilities.

**Typical Use Cases:**

1. **Modern Cloud Applications:** Azure SQL Database provides low-latency, high-throughput database service for cloud applications, with built-in intelligence that learns app patterns and adapts to maximize performance, reliability, and data protection.

2. **Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence:** With its ability to handle large volumes of data, support for advanced SQL functionality, and integration with Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI, Azure SQL Database is a good fit for data warehousing and BI scenarios.

3. **Data Migration:** Azure SQL Database is often used as a target for migrating on-premises SQL Server databases to the cloud. It provides near 100% compatibility with the latest SQL Server (on-premises) Database Engine.

4. **Microservices and Serverless Applications:** With its serverless compute tier, Azure SQL Database is a good fit for modern applications based on microservices and serverless architectures.

5. **Multi-Tenant Applications:** Azure SQL Database supports elastic pools, which allow you to manage and scale multiple databases in a cost-effective manner, making it a good fit for multi-tenant applications.

In summary, Azure SQL Database is a fully managed, secure, and intelligent relational database service that provides a wide range of capabilities for building, deploying, and managing applications.
