# Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

* Personally Identifiable Information (PII) refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual.
* This could be a standalone data element, like a name, address, email, phone number, or social security number, or it could be a combination of data elements.
* In a self-serve data platform, especially one that follows the principles of Data Mesh and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the classification and protection of PII data is of utmost importance due to privacy laws and regulations, such as GDPR in Europe and CCPA in California.

## How PII data can be classified and protected in such a context:

**1. Classification of PII Data:**
* The first step in protecting PII data is to identify and classify it. This involves:
  - **Data Discovery:** Use automated tools to scan and identify PII data across all your data products. This should be an ongoing process, as new data is constantly being added to the system.
  - **Data Cataloging:** Catalog all your data products and include metadata that indicates whether each data product contains PII data. This catalog should be accessible to all teams and should be kept up-to-date.
  - **Data Tagging:** Tag PII data within each data product. This could involve adding metadata tags to the data or storing the data in a specific way.

**2. Protection of PII Data:**
* Once PII data has been classified, it needs to be protected. This involves:
  - **Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures. Only authorized individuals should have access to PII data. This could involve role-based access control (RBAC), where individuals are granted access based on their role within the organization.
  - **Data Masking and Anonymization:** Use data masking or anonymization techniques to protect PII data. This could involve replacing the actual data with fictitious but realistic data (data masking) or removing identifying information from the data (anonymization).
  - **Encryption:** Encrypt PII data both at rest and in transit. This ensures that even if the data is intercepted or accessed without authorization, it cannot be read.
  - **Auditing and Monitoring:**
    * Regularly audit and monitor access to PII data.
    * This can help you identify any unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
  - **Data Retention and Deletion:**
    * Implement policies for data retention and deletion.
    * PII data should only be kept for as long as it is needed, and should be securely deleted once it is no longer required.

## How these principles can be applied within the context of Data Mesh and DDD:
* In the context of Data Mesh and DDD, these principles should be applied within each domain.
* Each team (or 'data product team') should be responsible for identifying, classifying, and protecting the PII data within their domain.
* This aligns with the principle of decentralization in both Data Mesh and DDD.
* Protection of PII data should be a key consideration when designing the model for each domain (as per DDD principles).
* This could involve designing the model in such a way that PII data is minimized or separated from other data.
* Ubiquitous language used in DDD should include terms and concepts related to PII data and its protection.
* This will ensure that all team members have a common understanding of what PII data is and how it should be handled.
