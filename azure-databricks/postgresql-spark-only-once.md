# Apache Spark - process PostgreSQL data only once

Absolutely, you have a PostgreSQL database that is continuously receiving new data, and you want to use Apache Spark to process these new data since the last run. Here is how you can accomplish this.

Firstly, let's clarify the term "exactly-once processing". In the context of data processing, this term refers to the guarantee that each record will be processed exactly once - meaning no record will be processed twice and no record will be missed. This is particularly important in data streaming and real-time data processing applications.

### Step-by-step process:

1. **Initial Setup:** Connect your Spark application to your PostgreSQL database. This can be done using the `spark.read.format("jdbc")` API, specifying the JDBC url, table name, and other connection properties.

2. **Track Last Processed Record:** In order to process only the new data, your Spark application needs to keep track of the last record it processed in its previous run. This can be achieved by storing the `id` and `created_at` of the last processed record. These details can be stored in a separate metadata table in your PostgreSQL database or in an external system like ZooKeeper or even a file system, depending on the robustness you need.

3. **Identifying New Data:** In the next run, the Spark application can retrieve the last processed record's details and use these to identify the new data. You can use a SQL query with a WHERE clause that selects records where `id` is greater than the last processed `id`, or `created_at` is later than the last processed record's `created_at`. The exact query will depend on whether `id` or `created_at` is more reliable for identifying new records.

4. **Processing New Data:** The new data identified by the above step can then be loaded into a Spark DataFrame and processed as per your business logic.

5. **Exactly-Once Processing:** To achieve exactly-once processing, you need to ensure that the update of the last processed record's details (step 2) and the processing of the new data (step 4) are done atomically. This means that if one fails, the other should also not be done. This can be achieved by using a transaction, either in your PostgreSQL database if it supports multi-statement transactions, or in your Spark application using a feature like Spark's RDD transformations which are lazily evaluated and atomic.

6. **Error Handling:** You should also have error handling mechanisms to handle situations where reading from the PostgreSQL database or processing in Spark fails. Depending on the error, the Spark application may need to retry reading/processing, skip the problematic record(s), or even stop and alert a human.

7. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Finally, you should have monitoring and alerts to track the progress of your Spark application, detect any issues, and notify the appropriate persons or systems when something goes wrong.

It's worth noting that while this approach will achieve exactly-once processing, it assumes that the `id` or `created_at` in your PostgreSQL table is strictly increasing and there are no late arrivals or updates to previously processed records. If these assumptions do not hold, you might need a more complex solution.

Also, please note that this is a high-level overview. The actual implementation will depend on the specifics of your PostgreSQL database, your Spark application, and your processing requirements.
