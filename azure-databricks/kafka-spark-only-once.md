# Kafka and Spark Streaming - exactly-once semantics

Apache Spark's integration with Apache Kafka is designed to provide exactly-once semantics for data processing, which means that each record from Kafka will be processed exactly once and no records will be missed or processed multiple times.

Here's how it works:

1. **Kafka Offsets:** Apache Kafka maintains a numeric offset for each record in a partition. This offset acts as a kind of bookmark that allows consumers to keep track of which records they have already read. When a Spark streaming job starts consuming data from Kafka, it begins from the smallest available offset by default.

2. **Spark's Kafka Direct Stream:** In the direct approach of Spark Streaming to connect to Kafka (introduced in Spark 1.3), Spark Streaming itself keeps track of the Kafka offsets. The Kafka Direct Stream approach ensures that the messages are effectively received once, despite failures, because Spark Streaming keeps track of the Kafka offsets internally. This approach does not rely on the use of ZooKeeper or any external service for storing offsets.

3. **Storing Offsets:** After processing the data, the processed offsets are stored back in Spark Streaming. This is done in the same write transaction as the results, ensuring that exactly-once semantics are maintained. In the event of a failure, the streaming job can be restarted and processing will resume from the stored offsets.

4. **End-to-End Exactly-Once Processing:** The above steps ensure that data is read exactly once from Kafka, but to guarantee end-to-end exactly-once semantics (i.e., ensuring that results are generated exactly once), you also need to ensure that output operation is idempotent. This means that even if an output operation is repeated (e.g., due to a failure before the processed offsets were saved), the same result should be generated. This can often be achieved by carefully designing your output operation (e.g., using idempotent writes in databases or ensuring that your business logic can handle duplicate writes).

So in summary, Apache Spark uses Kafka offsets to track the records that it has already read, but it does not mark records in Kafka as read. Instead, it keeps track of the offsets internally and uses this information to provide exactly-once semantics. It's also important to note that while Spark Streaming provides the tools to achieve exactly-once semantics, it also requires careful design of your output operation to ensure end-to-end exactly-once processing.
