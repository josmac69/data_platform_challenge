# Azure Event Hubs

* Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service provided by Microsoft as part of its Azure cloud services.
* It's designed to handle high volumes of data and provide real-time analytics.
* Once collected into Event Hubs, the data can be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.

## Technology:
* Event Hubs uses a publish-subscribe model, where producers send events to the hub, and consumers read those events in an ordered fashion.
* Under the hood, it uses Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and HTTP/2 for event transmission, ensuring efficient and reliable communication.

## Key Features:
- Stream millions of events per second
- Process or analyze data using real-time analytics providers
- Capture data into Azure Data Lake Storage or Azure Blob Storage
- Integrate seamlessly with a wide variety of downstream processing and storage services
- Use Apache Kafka producer and consumer APIs with your existing Kafka applications without changing any code

## Use Cases:

1. **Telemetry Data:** Event Hubs can ingest and process massive amounts of telemetry data sent from devices in an Internet of Things (IoT) scenario.

2. **Application Logging:** Applications can send logs to Event Hubs for ingestion, which can then be processed in real-time or batch-mode for diagnostics and analytics.

3. **Live Dashboarding:** Event Hubs can feed real-time data to live dashboards to reflect current system status or business metrics.

4. **Stream Processing:** Event Hubs can be used as an input to Azure Stream Analytics for real-time data transformation and analytics.

## Integration with Modern Data Platform:
* Azure Event Hubs fits into a modern data platform environment by acting as the "front door" for an event pipeline, often called an event ingestor in solution architectures.
* It's capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second, which can then be transformed and stored using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.

### In a typical data flow:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Devices, sensors, applications, or other services send events to Event Hubs.

2. **Stream Processing:** The data can then be processed in real-time using services like Azure Stream Analytics or Azure Functions.

3. **Data Storage:** After processing, the data can be stored in a database or data warehouse like Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis or batch processing.

4. **Data Analysis:** Finally, the data can be analyzed and visualized using tools like Power BI.

By providing a simple, secure, and scalable event ingestor, Azure Event Hubs plays a crucial role in the data engineering landscape, enabling real-time analytics and big data scenarios.
