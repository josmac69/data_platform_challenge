# GitHub Actions CI/CD

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) system fully integrated into GitHub. It allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository.

## How to set up GitHub Actions:

1. **Create a Workflow**:
   * Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.
   * To create a workflow, you add a YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
   * This file defines a set of jobs and steps that will be executed.
   * There are templates available for common workflows - on GitHub Marketplace.

2. **Define Jobs**: Jobs are a set of steps that execute on the same runner. You can define dependencies between jobs, and run jobs in parallel or sequentially.

3. **Define Steps**: Steps are individual tasks that can run commands or actions. Each step in a job executes on the same runner, allowing the steps to share data with each other.

4. **Use Actions**: Actions are standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job. Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow. You can create your own actions, or use actions shared by the GitHub community.

5. **Set Triggers**: You must define when your workflow will run. You can configure your workflow to run when specific activity on GitHub happens, at a scheduled time, or when an event outside of GitHub occurs.

To integrate GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you can use the respective actions provided by the cloud providers. For example, for deploying to Azure, you can use the `Azure/login` action to login to Azure, and then use other Azure actions to deploy your application.

## Pros of GitHub Actions:

- **Integrated with GitHub**: GitHub Actions is fully integrated with GitHub, making it easy to automate tasks right from your repository.

- **Community Actions**: You can use actions created by the GitHub community, which can save you time in writing your own scripts.

- **Matrix Builds**: GitHub Actions supports matrix builds, which allows you to test across multiple operating systems and runtime versions.

- **Live Logs**: GitHub Actions provides live logs of your workflow runs, making it easier to debug issues.

## Cons of GitHub Actions:

- **Limited Free Minutes**: GitHub provides a certain number of free minutes for Actions, but once you exceed this limit, you'll need to pay.

- **Complexity**: While GitHub Actions is powerful, it can be complex to set up, especially for more advanced workflows.

- **Limited Built-in Deployment Options**: While you can deploy to any cloud provider using scripts, GitHub Actions doesn't have as many built-in deployment options as some other CI/CD tools.

In conclusion, GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool that is fully integrated with GitHub. It's particularly well-suited to projects that are already on GitHub and that can benefit from the community actions available. However, for more complex workflows or projects with specific deployment needs, other CI/CD tools may be more suitable.
