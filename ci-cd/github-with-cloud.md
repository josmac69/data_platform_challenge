# GitHub usage with cloud

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool that can be integrated with various cloud providers. Here's how GitHub Actions can be integrated with the three main cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## AWS

AWS provides several GitHub Actions that help you build, test, and deploy applications on AWS. Here are some key steps to integrate GitHub Actions with AWS:

- **AWS Credentials**: First, you need to store your AWS credentials (AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) as secrets in your GitHub repository. You can do this in the repository settings under the "Secrets" section.

- **AWS Actions**: AWS provides several GitHub Actions that you can use in your workflows. For example, `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action can be used to configure AWS credentials. Other actions like `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login` and `aws-actions/beanstalk-deploy` can be used to login to Amazon ECR and deploy to Elastic Beanstalk respectively.

- **Workflow**: In your GitHub Actions workflow, you can use these actions along with other steps to build, test, and deploy your application.

## Azure

Azure also provides several GitHub Actions to help you deploy your applications. Here's how to integrate GitHub Actions with Azure:

- **Azure Credentials**: Similar to AWS, you need to store your Azure credentials as secrets in your GitHub repository. You can get these credentials from the Azure portal.

- **Azure Actions**: Azure provides several GitHub Actions that you can use in your workflows. For example, `azure/login` action can be used to login to Azure. Other actions like `azure/webapps-deploy` can be used to deploy your application to Azure Web Apps.

- **Workflow**: In your GitHub Actions workflow, you can use these actions along with other steps to build, test, and deploy your application.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

GCP also provides GitHub Actions to help you deploy your applications. Here's how to integrate GitHub Actions with GCP:

- **GCP Credentials**: You need to create a service account in GCP and download the JSON key file. This file contains the credentials that you need to store as a secret in your GitHub repository.

- **GCP Actions**: GCP provides several GitHub Actions that you can use in your workflows. For example, `google-github-actions/setup-gcloud` action can be used to setup the gcloud CLI in your workflow.

- **Workflow**: In your GitHub Actions workflow, you can use these actions along with other steps to build, test, and deploy your application.

In conclusion, GitHub Actions can be integrated with various cloud providers by storing the cloud credentials as secrets in your GitHub repository and using the respective GitHub Actions provided by the cloud providers in your workflows.
