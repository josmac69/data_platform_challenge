# Azure solution

* Description of high-level design of a modern, scalable, and resilient data platform using data mesh principles for Ancillary Marketplace (AMP) platform.
* It is based on Azure, but also mentions some tools from AWS and GCP where they might offer significant advantages.

**1. Data Ingestion:**

* Given the variety of data sources and the need for real-time, near-real-time, and batch data processing, Azure Data Factory would be a good choice for data ingestion.
* It supports a wide range of source systems and allows you to create data-driven workflows for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation.
* For real-time data ingestion, I can consider usage of Azure Event Hubs or Apache Kafka on Azure.
  * These services can handle high volumes of data in real-time and can integrate with various data producers and consumers.

**2. Data Storage:**

* For structured data, Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB can be used.
  * Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database with auto-scale, integral intelligence, and robust security.
  * Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that can scale within minutes and offers multiple well-defined consistency models.
* For unstructured or semi-structured data, Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage can be used.
  * These services offer massive scalability and high availability.

**3. Data Processing:**

* Azure Databricks, an Apache Spark-based analytics platform, can be used for big data processing and machine learning workloads.
* It can handle batch and real-time data processing and integrates well with other Azure services.

**4. Data Governance and Security:**

* Azure Purview can be used for data governance and managing data lineage.
  * It provides a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data.

* For data security, Azure provides a range of services and features, including Azure Security Center, Azure Active Directory, and Azure Private Link.
  * I can also use Azure Policy for implementing policy-based governance.

* For handling PII data, I can use Azure Information Protection for classifying, labeling, and protecting sensitive data.

**5. Data Analysis and Visualization:**

* Azure Synapse Analytics can be used for running big data and data warehousing workloads.
  * It integrates with Power BI for data visualization, and Azure Machine Learning for building machine learning models.

* For self-service BI, Power BI can be used.
  * It allows users to create reports and dashboards without much technical expertise.
  * I can also consider Azure Analysis Services for creating semantic data models that can be used by BI tools.

**6. Data Mesh Implementation:**

* For implementing data mesh principles, I can consider each product group (lounges, parking, taxis & rides, airport buses and trains, events, car rentals, accommodation etc.) as a separate domain with its own data product.
* Each data product can have its own data pipeline, storage, and services, managed by a separate team.

**7. Other Considerations:**

* For cost optimization, there is Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor.
* For monitoring and diagnostics, using Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics.

* For CI/CD, using Azure DevOps or GitHub.
* For containerization and orchestration, consider using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

* For data catalog, consider using Azure Data Catalog.
* For data quality, consider using Azure Data Quality.
* For data virtualization, consider using Azure Data Share.
* For data integration, consider using Azure Data Share.

**8. Other Cloud Providers:**
* While Azure provides a comprehensive set of tools for building your data platform, there are certain areas where AWS or GCP might offer advantages.
* For example, AWS's S3 service is often considered the gold standard for cloud object storage.
* Google's BigQuery is a powerful tool for running big data analytics workloads and might be easier to use than Synapse for some use cases.
