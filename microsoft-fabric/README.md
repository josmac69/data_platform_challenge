# Microsoft Fabric

Microsoft Fabric is a comprehensive, end-to-end analytics solution that combines various data and analytics capabilities into one streamlined service. It encompasses data movement, data lakes, data engineering, data integration, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence. All these capabilities are backed by a shared platform providing robust data security, governance, and compliance. This eliminates the need for your organization to stitch together individual analytics services from multiple vendors【7†source】.

The key components of Microsoft Fabric are:

1. **Data Engineering**: Provides a Spark platform with great authoring experiences, enabling data engineers to perform large scale data transformation and democratize data through the lakehouse. It also integrates with Data Factory for scheduling and orchestration of notebooks and Spark jobs.

2. **Data Factory**: Combines the simplicity of Power Query with the scale and power of Azure Data Factory, with over 200 native connectors to connect to data sources on-premises and in the cloud.

3. **Data Science**: Enables building, deploying, and operationalizing machine learning models seamlessly within your Fabric experience. It integrates with Azure Machine Learning to provide built-in experiment tracking and model registry, and allows business analysts to integrate predictions into their BI reports, shifting from descriptive to predictive insights.

4. **Data Warehouse**: Provides industry-leading SQL performance and scale, fully separates compute from storage, enabling independent scaling of both the components. It natively stores data in the open Delta Lake format.

5. **Real-Time Analytics**: Best in class engine for observational data analytics, capable of handling semi-structured data formats like JSON or Text coming in at high volume, with shifting schemas.

6. **Power BI**: World's leading Business Intelligence platform, ensuring that business owners can access all the data in Fabric quickly and intuitively to make better decisions with data.

Microsoft Fabric is built on a unified data lake called OneLake, which eliminates data silos by providing a single, unified storage system for all developers. Data discovery, data sharing, compliance with policy, and security settings are enforced centrally and uniformly. OneLake supports a hierarchical structure to simplify management across your organization, with no need for up-front provisioning. All the Microsoft Fabric compute experiences, like Data Engineering, Data Warehouse, Data Factory, Power BI, and Real-Time Analytics, are prewired to OneLake, requiring no extra configuration.

You can sign up for a free Fabric trial at app.fabric.microsoft.com without needing a credit card. For existing Power BI customers, you can sign up for a free Fabric trial using your Power BI account information.

Microsoft Fabric can be purchased by buying Fabric capacity, a billing unit that enables every Fabric experience. This allows you to pay for all your data tools in one transparent, simplified pricing model. The Fabric Capacity SKU will launch soon and offer pay-as-you-go pricing—in the meantime, Microsoft Fabric can be purchased through Power BI Premium capacity.

For users of existing Microsoft products such as Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, or Azure Data Explorer, Microsoft Fabric represents an evolution of those offerings in the form of a simplified SaaS solution that can connect to existing PaaS offerings. Migration paths will soon be made available to help transition teams that are ready to switch services.

In terms of learning resources, Microsoft offers various tutorials and demonstrations to help users get started with Fabric. Here are some links that might be of interest:
