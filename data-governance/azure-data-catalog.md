# Data Catalog on Azure

Creating and setting up a data catalog in Azure involves the following steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Before you can begin, you need to meet certain prerequisites. These include having a Microsoft Azure subscription and your own Azure Active Directory tenant. Due to Azure's security requirements, Azure Data Catalog has enforced Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2, so you may encounter errors running the registration tool if your machine is not updated for TLS 1.2.

2. **Create a Data Catalog**: Note that you can only create one data catalog per organization (Azure Active Directory domain). If the owner or co-owner of an Azure subscription who belongs to this Azure Active Directory domain has already created a catalog, then you can't create a catalog again even if you have multiple Azure subscriptions. To test whether a data catalog has been created by a user in your Azure Active Directory domain, you can go to the Azure Data Catalog homepage and verify whether you see the catalog. To create a new catalog, you need to go to the Azure portal, select 'Create a resource', and then select 'Data Catalog'. You then specify a name for the data catalog, the subscription you want to use, the location for the catalog, and the pricing tier, and then select 'Create'.

3. **Setup**: After creating the data catalog, go to the Azure Data Catalog homepage and select 'Publish Data'. From here, you can navigate to the 'Settings' page. In the 'Settings' page, you can verify your Azure Data Catalog edition (Free or Standard), enable authorizing Active Directory security groups to access Data Catalog and enable automatic adjustment of billing if you choose Standard edition as your pricing tier. Here, you can also add users for the data catalog, glossary administrator users, and other administrators for the data catalog. You have the option to add extra text that will be displayed in the portal title. Once you complete the 'Settings' page, you can then navigate to the 'Publish' page.

4. **Find a Data Catalog in the Azure Portal**: After the creation and setup, you can find the data catalog in the Azure portal. Sign in with the same account that you used to create the data catalog. Select 'All services' and then select 'Data Catalog'. You should see the data catalog you created in the list. If you don't, check your subscription, resource group, location, and tag filters at the top of the search. Select the catalog that you created. You will see the Data Catalog page in the portal, showing details for your Data Catalog. You can view properties of the data catalog and update them. For example, you can select 'Pricing tier' and change the edition.

Remember, the above steps are a generalized overview and the actual implementation might vary based on the specific requirements of your organization.
