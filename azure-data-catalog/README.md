# Azure Data Catalog

Azure Data Catalog is a fully managed service provided by Microsoft Azure that serves as a system of registration and discovery for enterprise data sources. It is designed to help businesses get more value from their existing data assets.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Source Registration:** Azure Data Catalog allows users to register their data sources in the catalog while keeping the data in its existing location. This means that the catalog contains information about the data source, but not the data itself.

2. **Data Discovery:** Once data sources are registered, they can be easily discovered through a search interface. Users can search for data sources based on their properties and can also see the relationships between different data sources.

3. **Metadata Management:** Azure Data Catalog stores metadata about each data source, including its location, schema, and usage information. Users can annotate data sources with additional metadata, such as descriptions and tags.

4. **Data Lineage and Relationships:** Azure Data Catalog allows users to understand the relationships between different data sources, providing insights into data lineage and dependencies.

5. **Access Control:** Azure Data Catalog provides fine-grained access control, allowing administrators to control who can view or manage data sources.

**Typical Use Cases:**

Azure Data Catalog is typically used in scenarios where businesses have a large number of data sources and need a way to catalog and discover them efficiently. Some use cases include:

1. **Data Governance:** Azure Data Catalog can be used to implement data governance policies by providing a central place to manage metadata and access control for all data sources.

2. **Data Discovery:** Azure Data Catalog makes it easy for users to discover relevant data sources for their work. This can improve productivity and reduce the time spent searching for data.

3. **Data Lineage:** Azure Data Catalog can be used to understand data lineage and dependencies, which can be important for impact analysis and data quality initiatives.

In summary, Azure Data Catalog is a cloud-based service that helps businesses manage, discover, and understand their data sources. It provides a central place to store and manage metadata for all data sources, making it easier for users to find and use the data they need.
